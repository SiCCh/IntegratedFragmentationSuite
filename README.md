## Software suite for simulating Collision-Induced-Dissociation(CID) of non-covalent clusters in soft-ionisation mass spectrometry
The distinction between available software programs for simulating CID processes and this program is that this is a statistical method that uses M3C software with CREST and AutoMeKin to reduce the computational expense of simulating these processes in the scale of supramolecular level systems. 

# For now the code is implemented by typing in command line
`python3 Integration1.py`

## Requirements:
Before running this code, please install:
1. pypackmol
2. **CREST** (with `xtb` and `xtbiff`)
3. **M3C** software
4. **AutoMeKin**
